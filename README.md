# Pascal's Triangle

In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients that arises in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra. The binomial expression is  (x + y)^n, where n can be any positive integer and x, y are real numbers. It is named after the 17th century French mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623 - 1662).

The triangular array of numbers begins with 1 on the top and with 1's running down the two sides of a triangle. Each new number lies between two numbers and below them, and its value is the sum of the two numbers above it.\
This triangle is used in different types of probability conditions.

## Example with 11 rows

## About The Project

This project creates a function in python to generate Pascal's triangle with n rows.

## Getting Started

Let's start to use this project.\
There is a python file with the code and a Jupyter Notebook to visualize the code execution in your browser.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 must be installed.

### Installation

To execute the project open the terminal and go to the project folder. Then execute it with python:

```sh
python3 pascals_triangle.py
```

You can also use Jupyter Notebook to execute it in your browser or text editor directly.
